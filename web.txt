The internet is just a network of computers that can communicate with one another. These computers are able to send data to and from one another in the form of packets which are snippets of data that can be pieced back together to form the finished product. The internet works by allowing this communication between user computers and servers which can store huge amounts of data. There are also routers that are connected to the internet and they act as a single access point for other networks to connect tot he internet. 
When you click a link, a request is sent to a server asking if it is ok to havew the information or go to the location from the link. The server will usually respond yes unless it is protected or an error occurs. When the server responds yes, it sends back its response along with the data from the link such as an image or new url for that takes the user to the desired location from the link.
